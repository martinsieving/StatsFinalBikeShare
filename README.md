To use the code, download and unzip the folder from Github, then open stat383_final_bikeshare.Rmd in RStudio. 
Install any missing required packages, then run the file. The plots can be viewed by scrolling down on the code. 

Alternatively, the output of the code can be viewed, without running the code, by opening the stat383_final_bikeshare.nb file. 
This will open a copy of the code after it has been run, including the plots generated by the code.
